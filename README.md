## 👋 Hi, I’m @C-Monaghan

**Psychologist, Data Scientist, & Chess Player**

- Bachelor in Psychology @Maynooth University (2018 - 2022).
- PhD in Data Science @Maynooth University (2022 - Present). 

I am interested in the effects procrastination has on older adults and am using R and data science to model causal pathways of procrastination. I am also investigating both the heath outcomes and financial decision making of older adults who procrastinate.
